  <h2>Jose</h2>
  <p>Hello everybody!! I am married with my beautifyl sweetheart, Alicia, we have our great blessing Benjamin 
    and he is 5 years old, I am from Peru, my city is wonderful and we 
    live in Ayacucho that is called the city of the 33 churches.</p>
    <p> I have been a memeber of the church of Jesus Christ of <latter-day>
    Saints since August 14th, 2010. The things I love about the church are that
    we know that families can be eternal and we can live with Jesus Christ and with them,
    another amzing part is that we can get revelation from prophets and Apostles as
    like in ancient times.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am an English teacher and I work in two schools, I work with children and teenagers,
    I am pursuing a masters of software development and plan to become my own boss with my family, I think technology is amazing
    and in this times Teachnology brings people closer.</p>
    <p>I enjoy cleaning my house with my wonderful wife and our beloved son, is fantastic to pass time with them,
    I love listening to music and singing, I like play soccer with my colleagues and watch action movies.
